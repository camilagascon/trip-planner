If elements executing HTTP GET or POST to Furkot (anchors or forms linking to `https://trips.furkot.com/trip`) exist on a page when its document is ready, they will be automatically discovered and modified to activate [Furkot] trip planner widget instead of redirecting to [Furkot].

`duration` (in milliseconds). Only `name` and `coordinates` (or `address` in absence of `coordinates`) are required.

```javascript
var tripPlanner = require('trip-planner');
var stops = [{
  name: 'Time Square',
  coordinates: {
    lat: 40.7577,
    lon: -73.9857

  coordinates: {
    lat: 40.7789,
